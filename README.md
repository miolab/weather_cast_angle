## Development information

### Pre-required

Can build the Docker image and launch the application using the following commands:

- Prepare `.env` file and set [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API key (required)

  ```sh
  cp .env.sample .env
  ```

- Run `mix git_hooks.install` to prepare local development

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies

### Start this application using docker container

To start the Phoenix server,

- Build the application container

  ```sh
  docker build -t weather_cast_angle .
  ```

  - For **development**, and if `docker compose` command is available, the following will work instead.

    ```sh
    docker compose build
    ```

- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server` using docker;

  ```sh
  docker run --rm -p 4000:4000 \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -e OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=$(cat .env | grep OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY | cut -d '=' -f2) \
  --name weather_cast_angle \
  weather_cast_angle
  ```

  - For **development**, and if `docker compose` command is available, the following will work instead.

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

- If want to run `iex -S mix`;

  ```sh
  docker exec -it weather_cast_angle iex -S mix
  ```

### Setting Up npm Execution Environment for Local Development

In local testing and development, an **npm** execution environment may be required for tasks such as installing **JavaScript libraries** (e.g., chart.js). The use of **nodenv** is recommended for preparing this environment.

To install **nodenv**, refer to the official installation guide: [nodenv installation](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation).

The Node.js version specified in the .node-version file can be installed locally by executing the following command:

```sh
nodenv install
```

This ensures the appropriate Node.js version is available for the development environment.
